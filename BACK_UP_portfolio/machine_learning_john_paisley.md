## Review

### Course Link
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-0">Machine Learning, CSM102x - John Paisley</a>

### Info
This is a very well taught, comprehensive course in machine learning by Prof. John Paisley, University of Columbia, in EdX. The course has sufficient theoretical depth and hands-on coding exercises which covers almost all of the key algorithms in machine learning. The course consists of 4 programming assignments, all of which does not have test data set for verifying your code before submission. Hence, I have provided below a list of test data set and the desired output to check for correctness of your code before submission. 

### Syllabus
Bayesian/maximum likelihood/maximum a-posteriori estimation, linear/logistic regression, perceptron/least squares, bias-variance, sparsity, Laplace approximation, kernel methods, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, boosting, clustering/k-NN, expectation-maximization, mixtures of Gaussian, matrix factorization, latent factor models, principal component analysis, hidden Markov models, discrete/continuous state space models 

<!-- ### Repository
The [repository](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/Machine-Learning-CSMM102x-John-Paisley-Columbia-University-EdX) consists of the following: 
* Projects - Instructions, test data sets, desired outputs, and Python solution codes -->

## Week 3 Project: Linear Regression

In part 1 of the project, we are required to compute the ridge regression weights $$w_{RR}$$ given values of $$y$$, $$\mathbf{X}$$, and lambda $$\lambda$$.

To solve, implement the equations given in Lecture 3, Slide 23.

![L3S23](/assets/images/machine_learning_john_paisley_p01_01.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" .align-center}

In part 2 of the project, we are required to give 10 data points to measure given values of $$y$$, $$\mathbf{X}$$, $$\lambda$$, and $$\sigma^2$$, via active learning procedure.

To solve, implement the active learning procedure given in Lecture 5, Slide 18 and update the posterior distribution following the equations in Lecture 5, Slide 16.

![L5S18](/assets/images/machine_learning_john_paisley_p01_03.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" .align-center}

Points to note:
* No preprocessing or normalization of the data is required 
* No need to remove the column of 1's 
* Use 1-based indexes for the position of the data point $$\left(y,\mathbf{x}\right)$$ to be measured

The [test data set](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w03_Linear_Regression.zip) and [desired output](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w03_Linear_Regression.zip) was generated using the following parameters:

$$
\begin{align}
	\text{dimension of vector }\mathbf{x}_i\text{, } d & = 3\\
	\text{covariate vectors in }\mathbf{X}_{train}\text{, } n_{train} & = 1000 \\
	\text{variance, }\sigma^2 & = 3 \\
	\text{lambda, }\lambda & = 2 \\
	\text{ true }\mathbf{w} & = \left[2, 3, 4\right]\\
	\text{covariate vectors in }\mathbf{X}_{test}\text{, } n_{test} & = 100 \\
\end{align}
$$

## Week 6 Project: Classification

We are required to implement a $$K$$-class Bayes classifier to compute the probability of a new data point belonging to each of the $$K$$-class. To achieve this, we also need to  compute the class prior probability $$\hat{\pi}_y$$, class-specific Gaussian mean $$\hat\mu_y$$ and covariance $$\hat\Sigma_y$$.

To solve, implement the equations given in Lecture 7, Slide 27.

![L7S27](/assets/images/machine_learning_john_paisley_p02_01.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" .align-center}

The [test data set](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w06_Classification.zip) and [desired output](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w06_Classification.zip) was generated using $$K = 6$$ classes having index values $$0,1,2,...,5$$. A smaller number of classes was used to simplify simulation data. After verification, please reset number of classes $$K = 10$$ in your code before submission.

## Week 9 Project: Clustering

We are required to implement K-means clustering and EM Gaussian Mixture Models on a set of input covariate vectors $$\mathbf{x}_i$$. To solve, implement the equations on Lecture 14, Slide 15 and Lecture 16, Slide 20 for K-means clustering and EM GMM, respectively.

The [test data set](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w09_Clustering.zip) and [desired output](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w09_Clustering.zip) was generated using $$K = 3$$ , to simplify simulation. After verification, please reset number of clusters to 5 in your code before submission.

               [0.0887880161461, 3.5291769851],

## Week 12 Project: Matrix Factorization

We are required to implement the probablistic matrix factorization (PMF) model. To solve, implement the equations on Lecture 17, Slide 19.

![L17S19](/assets/images/machine_learning_john_paisley_p04_01.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" .align-center}

The [test data set](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w12_Matrix_Factorization.zip) provided has 1200 rows of ratings, with `Nu = 100` users and `Nv = 100` objects.

For PMF algorithm, in order to match your code output with the provided [desired output file](/assets/portfolio/machine_learning_john_paisley/w12_Matrix_Factorization.zip), please use the following initialization. Here, $$\text{dim}=d$$, $$\text{mu}=\mu$$, $$\text{variance}=\sigma^2$$, $$\text{lambdaParam}=\lambda$$, $$\text{Umatrix}=\mathbf{U}$$, and $$\text{Vmatrix}=\mathbf{V}$$

```python
dim = 5 #matrix dimension U = Nu x dim, V = Nv x dim
mu = 0
variance = 1/10
lambdaParam = 2
Umatrix = np.zeros((Nu,dim)) #Initialize Umatrix of size Nu x dim
```

Additionally, initialize `Vmatrix` of size `Nv x dim` by the values provided in the file "Vmatrix_initial_values.csv" in the project repository.

Shown below is the maximization of the log joint likelihood objective function versus iteration number, produced by my Python solution for this project.
