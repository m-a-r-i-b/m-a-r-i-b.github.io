## Review

### Course Link
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x">Learning from data - Yaser S.Abu Mostafa</a>

### Info
This course is taught by by Prof. Yaser S.Abu Mostafa, Caltech, in EdX. I believe this course and the accompanying notes/textbook is the best course to gain a clear understanding of Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Among all the courses/textbooks that I have read, these two algorithms are best taught by Prof. Yaser.

### Syllabus
Feasibility of learning, neural networks, support vector machines, conjugate gradient descent.
