## Introduction

The figure below shows a typical data engineering pipeline for a production system, where each block is a microservice launched from a Docker container. Docker is used for ease of deployment, environment agnostic characteristics, modularity (i.e., microservice), scalability, and maintainability in the long run.

It consists of

+ REST api
+ Streaming of sensor inputs
+ Kafka for message queueing/passing
+ Signal processing blocks
+ Database (e.g., MongoDB, InfluxDB)
+ Visualization tool (e.g., Grafana)
+ GUI

In this project, we focus purely on developing the timeseries database, [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), and visualizing of the timeseries data using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). For simplicity, the input to InfluxDB is simulated using a mock data generator. Building the remainder of the data pipeline shown above is discussed in my other two projects, namely, [IceCream API](https://adaickalavan.github.io/portfolio/icecreamapi/) and [RTSP Video Streaming, Kafka, and Microservices](https://adaickalavan.github.io/portfolio/rtsp_video_streaming/) projects.

The end product of this project should appear as follows.

## Learning Outcome

The [repository](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/Timeseries-Database-and-Visualization) contains the following:

At the end of this project, we should be able to:
+ use dockerized InfluxDB and Grafana
+ visualize timeseries data in Grafana
+ query time series data in Grafana
