### Notes
1. **IntelliJ-Idea setup**  
    Users of IntelliJ-Idea as their Scala IDE might have encountered the following problem. Assume you have a scala class with accompanying methods written in a Foo.scala file.
    ```scala
    //File : Foo.scala
    class Foo {
      def foo1: Int = 2
    }
    ```
    Then you try to import the Foo class into a worksheet named Bar.sc to test the behaviour of your Foo class.
    ```scala
    //File : Bar.sc
    import Foo
    object Bar {
      val bar1 = new Foo
    }
    ```
    Everything works fine initially. However, if you return to Foo.scala file and make some changes, these changes will not be picked up by your Bar.sc worksheet. Errors such as "Object cannot be found" (i.e., referring to your new/modified object in Foo.scala file) will be thrown when trying to run your worksheet. Rebuilding, recompiling, or "Make Project" does not help. 

    However, upon restarting the IntelliJ application, your Bar.sc worksheet will work flawlessly and detect the new changes in Foo.scala file.

    Do the following to solve the problem:
    * Go to File -> Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> Scala -> Worksheet (tab)
    * Unselect "Run worksheet in the compiler process"

2. **Running tests in sbt**  
    To test only specific classes (e.g., `MySuite`) and sepcific test cases (e.g., `testName`) in your test suite, execute the following command in sbt
    ```scala
    test:testOnly *MySuite -- -z testName
    ```
    to run only the tests whose name includes the substring "testName". For exact match rather than substring, use -t instead of -z.

## Course 1: Functional programming principles in Scala
### Week 4: Pattern matching

In lecture 5, week 4, on the topic of pattern matching, we are given a programming exercise shown in the image below, for which the solution was not given in class. 

![scala](/assets/images/scala_c1_w4_l05_01.jpg){:height="60%" width="60%" .align-center}

I have provided my solution to this in-class exercise. The underscore ```_``` acts as a wildcard representing anyting in Scala.

```scala
object week4_5{

  trait Expr
  case class Number(n: Int) extends Expr
  case class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr
  case class Var(x: String) extends Expr
  case class Prod(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr

  def show(e:Expr):String = {
    def format(e:Expr):String = {
      e match{
        case Sum(_,_) => "(" + show(e) + ")"
        case _ => show(e)
      }
    }
    e match{
      case Number(x) => x.toString
      case Sum(l,r) => show(l) + "+" + show(r)
      case Var(x) => x
      case Prod(l,r) => format(l) + "*" + format(r)
    }
  }

  show(Sum(Number(1),Number(64)))
  show(Sum(Prod(Number(2),Var("x")),Var("y")))
  show(Prod(Sum(Number(2),Var("x")),Var("y")))

}
```

The output upon evaluating the above worksheet is:
```scala
defined trait Expr
defined class Number
defined class Sum
defined class Var
defined class Prod

show: show[](val e: Expr) => String

res0: String = 1+64
res1: String = 2*x+y
res2: String = (2+x)*y
```

### Week 6: Putting the pieces together

In lecture 5, week 6, we are given a programming exercise on obtaining all phrases of words that can serve as mnemonics for a phone number. The URL to download the vocabulary is not clear from the instructional video. 

![scala](/assets/images/scala_c1_w6_l05_01.jpg){:height="60%" width="60%" .align-center}

Hence, we provide the complete line of code to download the vocabulary: 

```scala
val in = Source.fromURL("https://lamp.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lamp/files/teaching/progfun/linuxwords.txt")
```

## Course 2: Functional program design in Scala
### Week 3 Assignment: ScalaCheck
In this week's assignment, we are tasked with writing properties to be checked by ScalaCheck. The default assignment code guides us to write a heap generator `genHeap` of type `Gen[H]` and define an implicit val `arbHeap` of type `Arbitrary[H]`. When a `property` is executed, the `forAll` function searches for a corresponding implicit `Arbitrary[H]` generator matching its required input `h:H`. An example is given below to illustrate this, where the `arbHeap` will be used as the implicit generator to produce its input `h` of typ `H`. 
```scala
  lazy val genHeap: Gen[H] = for {
    x <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[A]
    h <- Gen.frequency((45, Gen.const(empty)),(55,genHeap))
  } yield insert(x, h)

  implicit lazy val arbHeap: Arbitrary[H] = Arbitrary(genHeap)

  property("property1") = forAll{(h: H) =>
    val m = if (isEmpty(h)) 0 else findMin(h)
    findMin(insert(m, h)) == m
  }
```
In practice, it is best to avoid implicit parameters, such as implicit generators given by `Arbitrary[T]` values, to increase code comprehension. The above example is reproduced below with the generator for input `h:H` being explicitly defined as `genHeap`. This removes the need to define an intermediary `implicit val`.
```scala
  lazy val genHeap: Gen[H] = for {
    x <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[A]
    h <- Gen.frequency((45, Gen.const(empty)),(55,genHeap))
  } yield insert(x, h)

  property("property1") = forAll(genHeap){(h: H) =>
    val m = if (isEmpty(h)) 0 else findMin(h)
    findMin(insert(m, h)) == m
  }
```

### Week 4 Lecture 3: Functional reactive programming
Odersky describes the "Signal" method for reactive programming, using a bank account example. In order to track the logic while using "Signal", an "accounts.scala" file is provided in the repository (in addition to "accounts.sc" file) with many helpful print statements. Running "accounts.scala" file in debug mode, will print key values at intermediate stages, thus allowing us to track the logic behind "Signal" operation. 
```scala
  println("xxx.caller->"+caller) //print identity of caller
  println("xxx.observers->"+observers) //print identity of observers in the set
  println("xxx.this->"+this) //print identitiy of the current object
```

In short, we should remember the following points to understand "Signal":
1. On instantiation or upon being called, Signal A updates its formula/definition in the ```myExpr = () => expr``` variable. Signal A also updates its ```myValue``` variable.
1. Whenever an object B calls Signal A, Signal A stores the identity of the object B in its observers list. This is achieved via ```observers += caller.value``` in ```def apply()``` function.
1.  Whenever a Signal A is updated or evaluated, it updates its ```myValue``` variable via ```myValue = newValue``` operation in ```protected def computeValue()``` function. Additionally, Signal A calls all of its observers to update their values too via ```observers = Set.empty; obs.foreach(_.computeValue())``` in ```protected def computeValue()``` function. 

Notice that the observers list of a Signal A is emptied after calling its observers. The observers list of Signal A will be populated again when some other object B calls Signal A in order to compute object B's ```myValue``` variable.

### Week 4 Assignment: Calculator
Contrary to the `Signal` class introduced during Lecture 3, the `Signal` class provided in the assignment has an additional `var observed` besides the original `var observers`. Here `observers` refer to objects which are dependent on me whereas `observed` refers to objects that I depend on. The relevant portions of the code are shown below.
```scala
class Signal[T](expr: => T) {

  private var observers: Set[Signal[_]] = Set()
  private var observed: List[Signal[_]] = Nil
  ...

  protected def computeValue(): Unit = {
      for (sig <- observed)
        sig.observers -= this
      observed = Nil
      ...
    }

  ...

  def apply() = {
      ...
      caller.value.observed ::= this
      myValue
    }
}
```
The principles of `var observed` is described next using an example. Assume we have 3 `Signals` defined as follows:
```scala
val a = Var(1)
val b = Var(a() + 1)
val c = Var(b() + 1)
```
On iniatilization of the three signals, the table below shows the `var observers` and `var observed` of each signal.

| Signal | observers | observed |
|:------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| a      | b         | none     |
| b      | c         | a        |
| c      | none      | b        |

If at a later time, the `expr` of signal `b` is changed to `b() = 2`, then value of signal `c` will be recomputed accordingly. The `var observers` and `var observed` list will be updated to become:

| Signal | observers | observed |
|:------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| a      | none      | none     |
| b      | c         | none     |
| c      | none      | b        |

Since signal `b` does not depend on signal `a` anymore, signal `b` is removed from `var observers` of signal `a`. Hence, in future, if signal `a` is updated, it does not need to inform or call signal `b` anymore.

Note that the `Signal` class works correctly even without `var observed`. In the example above, without use of `var observed`, signal `a` makes a redundant call to signal `b` when signal `a` is updated in the future. Essentially, use of `var observed` avoids unnecessary computations.


## Course 3: Parallel Programming
Scala codes used in the parallel programming lectures are available at the [intructors GitHub website](https://github.com/axel22/parprog-snippets).

### Week 1 Lecture 3: Resolving Deadlocks
In this lecture, we are taught of `class Account` and of acquiring synchronized locks in the order of an unique ID to avoid deadlock situations. All instances of the `class Account` need to obtain an unique ID. This may be achieved via a companion `object Account` as shown next. Please refer to [week1_2.sc worksheet](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/Functional-Programming-in-Scala-Specialization-EPFL-Coursera/blob/master/Parallel%20Programming/exercise/src/main/scala/week1_2.sc) in the repository for the complete working example using companion object.

```scala
object Account{
  def apply(amount:Int = 0): Account = new Account(amount)

  private var uidCount: Long = 0L

  def getUniqueId():Long = this.synchronized {
    uidCount = uidCount + 1
    uidCount
  }
}

class Account(private var amount: Int = 0){
  import Account._

  val uid = getUniqueId()

  private def lockAndTransfer(target: Account, n:Int): Unit ={...}

  def transfer(target: Account, n:Int): Unit = {...}
}
```

### Week 1 Lecture 8: Scalameter
In this week, we are introduced to Scalameter library to measure the performance of our Scala code in terms of time, memory, etc. Remember to use the right version of Scalameter library compatible to your installed Scala version. If in doubt, please verify the compatible versions at [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.storm-enroute/scalameter-core). Below are examples of compatible Scalameter libraries for different Scala versions.
```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"
libraryDependencies += "com.storm-enroute" %% "scalameter-core" % "0.6"
```
```scala
scalaVersion := "2.12.4"
libraryDependencies += "com.storm-enroute" %% "scalameter-core" % "0.10"
```

## Course 4: Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark
###  Week 1 Lectures

1. While running Spark, your SBT shell may be inundated with `INFO` messages, preventing us from focusing on the program output.
    ![scala](/assets/images/scala_c4_w1_a01_03.jpg){:height="120%" width="100%" .align-center}
    To suppress the above `INFO` messages of Spark, include the following in your Scala code:
    ```scala
    // Create spark session
    val spark:SparkSession = SparkSession.builder()
                                         .appName("MyApp")
                                         .config("spark.master", "local")
                                         .getOrCreate()
    // Set log message level
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("ERROR")
    ```

###  Week 2 Assignment: StackOverflow
A couple of key points on `Option` type and data shuffling is discussed below, which are useful in this week's and general Spark programming.

1. `Options` can be viewed as collections. We can `flatMap` a `Collection[Option[_]]` to `Collection[_]`. For example we can `flatMap` `List[Option[_]]` to `List[_]`. For example, the following code 
    ```scala
    object exercise {
        // instantiate sample list
        val num = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
        // method 1: map
        val numMap = num.map(p => if (p%2 == 0) Some(p*2) else None)
        // method 2: flatMap
        val numFlatMap = num.flatMap(p => if (p%2 == 0) Some(p*2) else None)
        // method 3: flatMap in for loop
        for {
          num: Option[Int] <- numMap
          out: Int <- num
        } yield out
    }
    ```
    will output:
    ```scala
    num: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

    numMap: List[Option[Int]] = List(None, Some(4), None, Some(8), None, Some(12), None)

    numFlatMap: List[Int] = List(4, 8, 12)

    res0: List[Int] = List(4, 8, 12)
    ```

1. For each iteration, in the k-means clustering, we need to group points together and update the cluster mean values. The first method below is straightforward, but it is slow due to large data shuffling since we use `groupBy` first.
    ```scala
    val cluster: RDD[(Int, Iterable[(LangIndex, HighScore)])] = vectors.groupBy(p => findClosest(p,means))
    val newMeansRdd: Array[(Int, (LangIndex, HighScore))] = cluster.mapValues(p => averageVectors(p)).collect()
    ```
    An alternative method provided below is faster, since we create a pair RDD and use `reduceByKey` first, thus reducing the amount of data shuffling. However, this method should not be used in this assignment since the `averageVectors` method is not associative due to the use of `.toInt` rounding function.
    ```scala
    val cluster: RDD[(Int, (LangIndex, HighScore))] = vectors.map(p => (findClosest(p,means),p))
    val newMeansRdd: Array[(Int, (LangIndex, HighScore))] = cluster.reduceByKey((a, b) => averageVectors(Iterable(a,b))).collect()
    ```

###  Week 4 Lectures: Dataframes

Some of the in-class Spark exercises are provided as `.scala` file in `Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark -> exercise` [folder](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/Functional-Programming-in-Scala-Specialization-EPFL-Coursera/tree/master/Big%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Scala%20and%20Spark/exercise/src/main/scala) of the repository, for the readers to try out and get an understanding of the Spark Dataframe APIs. 

Additionally examples of Spark transformations and actions on Dataframes are also implemented in [Databricks Community](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) and the [notebook](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/Functional-Programming-in-Scala-Specialization-EPFL-Coursera/tree/master/Big%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Scala%20and%20Spark/DatabricksCommunity) is available in this course repository. 

Some of the operations excuted in Databricks Community.
```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

// Create spark session 
val spark:SparkSession = SparkSession.builder()
                                     .appName("MyApp")
                                     .getOrCreate()

// Create spark context
import spark.implicits._

// Define dataset
case class Employee(id: Int, fname:String, lname:String, work:Array[Int], city:String, age:Int)
val emp = Seq(Employee(12,"Joe","Smith",Array(38,67,89),"New York",34),
                Employee(645,"Slate","Markham",Array(28,3),"Sydney",2),
                Employee(12,"Sally","Owens",Array(48,1,0),"New York",12),
                Employee(221,"Joe","Walker",Array(21),"Sydney",89),
                Employee(12,"Joe","Runner",Array(21),"Sydney",89),
                Employee(645,"Slate","Ontario",Array(12,3),"Wellington",25))
// Convert dataset to RDD 
val empRDD = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(emp)
// Convert dataset to Dataframe
val empDF = emp.toDF
// Convert Dataframe to RDD
val empRDDfromDF = empDF.rdd

// Visualize Dataframe
empDF.printSchema()
empDF.show()
```
