<p> Machine learning predominantly uses Python as the programming language. For python programming, the free Anaconda distribution is suggested, which is available at <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Continuum</a>. This distribution installs a complete set of Python tools needed. It includes an integrated development environment (IDE) Spyder.</p>
        
<p>Below is my personal guide to self learn the art of machine learning. It is assumed that you have substantial prior knowledge of statistics, linear algebra, and digital signal processing.</p>

<p>A plethora of online courses are on offer for the topics of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing by various online course platforms. Some of the notable online course websites are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Courses are conducted by university professors</li>
      <li>Syllabus of online courses is similar to that in the corresponding university's on-campus program</li>
      <li>Have standalone courses and Specializations</li>
      <li>Free to audit, pay for verified certificate</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Courses are conducted by industry professionals/engineers</li>
      <li>Syllabus is created by engineers, intuition/practical/project oriented teaching, and has less theoretical rigour</li>
      <li>Have standalone courses and Nanodegrees</li>
      <li>Free to audit standalone courses, pay for verified certificate, and pay upfront for Nanodegrees</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>Courses which I have personally taken and verify to be good are as follows. In the deluge of online courses offered currently, only the best are listed below. They are ordered in my personal suggested sequence of study. These online courses provide good teachers, sufficient theoretical fundamentals, and hands-on programming exercises, along with intuitive understanding of the subject matter.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other Machine Learning courses available on the internet. It is a matter of trial and error in finding the good online courses. Please do share with me, if you find any other good online courses in Machine Learning.</p>
