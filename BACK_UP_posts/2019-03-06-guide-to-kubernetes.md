I highly recommend the `Golden Guide To Kubernetes Application Development` book by Matthew Palmer for beginners to master Kubernetes. The book guides us step by step, while covering all necessary commands/concepts, to successfully deploy our containers in Kubernetes.

Free articles/snippets from the book can be found [here](https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/#free-chapter).

The book is worth the USD 29.00 it is currently selling for. Buy the book at Matthew Palmer's [website](https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/).
