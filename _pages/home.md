Is randomness a precursor to consciousness --

Started my career at [Systems Limited](https://www.systemsltd.com/), in 2017. Since 2021, I have been with [Folio3](https://folio3.com/). Before switching completely to Ai, I did a bit of everything from frontend development with frameworks such as Angular & React to backend engineering with NestJs, Prisma ORM & MonogoDB. Wrote a few pipelines here and there to automate artifact (npm packages) generation and publishing process. 

My initial projects in Ai involved solving problems related to computer vision & building efficient video processing pipelines. Lately I have been focusing more on LLMs at work and as my hobby projects too. A year ago I built a LLM powered agent, capable of coding & version control tasks. Currently am working on its extension and building a mechanism/framework that involves orchestration of various LLM agents, its architecture is inspired by meta-gpt & gpt-pilot.


Technologies that I have worked with include : LangChain, LangFuse, Python, OpenCV, Gstreamer, TensorRT, ONNX, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker, Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, K8, Javascript, NestJs, Prisma, Mongo, Angular, React, Webpack, NodeJs, Ionic.
