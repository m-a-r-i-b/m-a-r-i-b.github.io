Is randomness a precursor to consciousness --

Started my career at [Systems Limited](https://www.systemsltd.com/), in 2017. Since 2021, I have been with [Folio3](https://folio3.com/). Before switching completely to Ai, I did a bit of everything from frontend development with frameworks such as Angular & React to backend engineering with NestJs, Prisma ORM & MonogoDB. Wrote a few pipelines here and there to automate artifact (npm packages & docker images) generation and publishing process. 

My initial projects in Ai involved solving problems related to computer vision & building efficient video processing pipelines. Lately I have been focusing primarily on LLMs at work and in my hobby projects too. Especially on the orchestration mechanism of multi agent systems.

+ <a href="/year-archive/">Posts</a> tab contains my blog posts or tech talks.


Technologies that I have worked with include : LangChain, LangFuse, Python, OpenCV, Gstreamer, TensorRT, ONNX, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker, Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, K8, Javascript, NestJs, Prisma, Mongo, Angular, React, Webpack, NodeJs, Ionic.
