Is randomness a precursor to consciousness --

Started my career as a web engineer at [Systems Limited](https://www.systemsltd.com/), where between 2017 & 2021 I developed different hybrid mobile and web apps with Javascript frameworks such as React, Ionic & Angular. Since 2021 I have been working with [Folio3](https://folio3.com/) as a deep learning engineer, primarily on computer vision projects revolving around object detection, image and video processing. 


Technologies that I have worked with include : Python, OpenCV, Gstreamer, TensorRT, ONNX, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker, Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, K8, Javascript, Angular, React, Webpack, NodeJs, Ionic.
